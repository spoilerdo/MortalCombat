# MortalCombat
A small pixel art game with some basic LAN network functions.

### Story
This game is a street-fighter type game but different because you have all sorts of events that can happen during the fight. 
You can play against the AI or you can use two controllers so you can play it with your friends at home.

### Why did i made it
The game is a HAVO school research project about learning the basics of C# and LAN network games.
After I graduated from school I began to develop the game to a single player game.
